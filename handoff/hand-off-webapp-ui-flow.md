# Hand-off: Webapp UI Flow

## Removed routes

- `/person` and `/api/person` were removed on 2026-07-23. Do not restore their
  breadcrumb or authentication-proxy entries unless the feature is intentionally
  reintroduced.
- โมดูล "เร่งรัดติดตาม" (`/rapid`, `/api/rapid`) was removed on 2026-08-28 together with
  its badge, breadcrumb, legacy `/rapid/{report_id}` redirects, and `rapid*`
  styles. Its right-aligned main-tab slot is now held by the GIS module.
  Transform tables `s_dm_control`, `s_dm_screen_risk`, `s_ht_screen_risk`, and
  `s_epi2` were left untouched.

## Removed features (2026-10-10)

Main tab bar = `ปริมาณข้อมูล` (`/import-check/index`), `คุณภาพ` (`/quality`), `GIS`
(`/gis`) on the left + `Add-On` dropdown at the far right. Every feature with no
tab/link left was deleted together with its API routes, libs, CSS, tests,
breadcrumb/proxy entries and redirects. DB tables, migrations, transform SQL and
sync jobs were **not** touched. Do not restore without re-adding an entry point.

- คุณภาพ เหลือแค่ `/quality/person-dup` (PERSON - TYPEAREA ซ้ำ): ลบ
  `/quality/service-instype-err`, `/quality/specialpp-error` และ API `/api/quality/*`
  ของสองหัวข้อนี้ (+ export) รวมถึง `components/fiscal-year-filter.jsx`,
  `components/affiliation-filter.jsx` ที่ไม่มีหน้าใช้แล้ว (transform `t_specialpp_error`
  ยังรันอยู่)
- ข้อมูลพื้นฐาน: `/standard/*` (index, person-typearea, person-pyramid),
  `/dashboard/person-target`, `/api/person-target`, `/api/person-pyramid`
- กลุ่มเป้าหมาย: `/target-group/*` (index, kpi, kpi/dm-ht), `/api/dm-ht-count` (+ export)
- Work Load: `/workload/*`, `/api/visit-monthly-workload` (+ export),
  `/api/ncdscreen-workload` (+ export)
- รายงาน: `/report/index`, `/dashboard/report`, `/api/report`, `lib/report-sql.mjs`
- Ask AI: `/ai/chat`, `/api/ai/chat`, `/api/ai/export/[filename]`,
  `ai_system_prompt.json`, `lib/{ai-chart,ai-db-catalog,db-query-tool,hdc-api-tool,excel-export-tool}.mjs`
- `/person`, `/api/person`; `/api/import-status` + `components/importing-guard.jsx`
  (only the report/AI pages used them — `lib/import-status.mjs` stays for
  `/api/dashboard` and the cache daemon)
- Redirects `/dashboard/person-target`, `/standard/dm-ht-count`,
  `/target-group/kpi/dm-ht-count` were dropped (targets gone → plain 404).
- `/dashboard/{hos-list,log-import,quality}/page.js` stay: they are the source files
  re-exported by `/import-check/files-count`, `/import-check/log-import`, `/quality`.

## GIS module

- `/gis` (label `GIS`, lucide `Map`) is the third tab of the left group in
  `main-tab.jsx`. `<AddonTab />` is the last child of the nav and
  `.addonTabWrap { margin-left: auto }` pushes it to the right edge of the tab bar.
  An open Add-On menu uses `.addonTabButton.tabButtonActive` (panel background, not
  the solid accent) so it never looks like the current module.
- `/gis` is listed in `PROTECTED_PAGE_PREFIXES` in `webapp/proxy.js`, so anonymous
  visitors are sent to login and `guest` (role ID 4) is denied; `user`, `superuser`,
  and `admin` can access it. The read-only `/api/gis/*` endpoints remain public.
- Breadcrumb entry: `{ prefix: "/gis", href: "/gis", label: "GIS" }` in
  `module-header.jsx`.
- `webapp/app/gis/page.js` renders `ModuleHeader` + `<GisMap />`. `/gis` deliberately
  has **no** `BREADCRUMB_MODULES` entry, so no `GIS` breadcrumb line renders above
  the map — the main tab already names the module and the map gets the height.
- Focused source tests: `webapp/tests/module-header.test.mjs`,
  `webapp/tests/gis-map.test.mjs`.

### Leaflet map

- `webapp/components/gis-map.jsx` is a client component. `leaflet` is loaded with a
  lazy `import("leaflet")` inside `useEffect` because Leaflet needs `window`. `leaflet/dist/leaflet.css` is a
  static import in that file.
- A `mapRef` guard keeps React StrictMode's double mount in dev from raising
  "Map container is already initialized"; the cleanup calls `map.remove()`.
- Leaflet's own `L.control.layers` is not used. The three base layers are switched
  from a segmented button-group toggle (`.gisLayerToggle`) that the component
  renders itself and positions absolutely over the map's top-right corner
  (`z-index: 1000`, above Leaflet's own controls). The active button carries
  `aria-pressed` and `.gisLayerToggleBtnActive`.
- Layer state lives in React (`activeLayer`); an effect adds the selected
  `L.tileLayer` and removes the others. The tile layers are built once into
  `layersRef` when the map is created, and a `ready` flag keeps that effect from
  running before the async `import("leaflet")` resolves.
- The three options are แผนที่ถนน (OpenStreetMap, the default), ภาพถ่ายดาวเทียม
  (Esri World Imagery), and ภูมิประเทศ (OpenTopoMap, capped at `maxZoom: 17`
  because that is as deep as its tiles go). All three are keyless public tile
  services and each carries its provider attribution.
### Data layers panel

- One panel entry renders one `.gisDataPanel` in the shared `.gisMapPanels` stack
  under the tile toggle, and each layer inside it renders one checkbox. The panel
  list is built in the component: `BASE_DATA_PANEL` (`ชั้นข้อมูลพื้นฐาน` →
  ขอบเขตตำบล) is a static const, while `ชั้นข้อมูลกลุ่มเปราะบาง` is built from
  `vulnerableTypes`. `dataLayers` is `layerPanels.flatMap(...)`, so the
  fit/toggle/style effects keep working on a flat list — they take `dataLayers` in
  their deps because that list grows once the lookup arrives.
- The vulnerable panel has **one checkbox per `c_vulnerable` row**, not one for the
  whole group. `GET /api/gis/c-vulnerable` returns the `is_active = 1` rows, and
  `vulnerableLayer()` turns each into a layer with id `vulnerable-<id>` hitting
  `/api/gis/vulnerable?vulnerable=<id>`. Each group gets its own colour from
  `VULNERABLE_COLORS` (cycled by index — the lookup has no colour column) and its
  pin glyph from `c_vulnerable.icon`, so the groups stay distinguishable on the map. A panel with no layers renders nothing
  rather than an empty box.
- A layer carrying a `pin` config is drawn through `pointToLayer` as an
  `L.marker` with an `L.divIcon` — a teardrop pin (`.gisPin`, a circle with one
  square corner rotated -45°) holding an icon that conveys the type. `iconAnchor`
  puts the pin's tip on the real coordinate. The glyphs live in `PIN_ICONS` as raw
  lucide SVG path markup, because `divIcon` takes an HTML string rather than a
  React element; an unknown icon name falls back to `DEFAULT_PIN_ICON` instead of
  rendering an empty pin.
- Markers have no `setStyle`, so the basemap restyle skips any layer without a
  `style` — pins keep their colour and stay legible on imagery through their white
  border.
- Clicking a pin opens a popup (`vulnerablePopupHtml`) with name, กลุ่ม, เพศ,
  วันเกิด (converted to พ.ศ. with the age), หน่วยบริการ and PID; pins have no hover
  tooltip. Boundary polygons still use a hover tooltip with `name_th`. The popup
  HTML is assembled by hand, so every DB value goes through `escapeHtml` first.
- `ขอบเขตตำบล` is **on by default**: the initial `activeDataLayers` state is derived
  from each entry's `defaultOn` flag, so turning another layer on by default is a
  config change, not a state change.
- The map's opening view fits that layer's extent rather than the fixed province
  view: once Leaflet is ready the component fetches the boundary GeoJSON, takes
  `L.geoJSON(geojson).getBounds()`, and calls `fitBounds` with 16px padding.
  `fittedRef` keeps it to one fit, and an invalid or failed load leaves
  `DEFAULT_CENTER` / `DEFAULT_ZOOM` in place. `DEFAULT_FIT_LAYER_ID` names the
  layer the fit is taken from.
- `fetchLayerGeoJson` caches each layer's GeoJSON in `geoJsonCacheRef`, so the
  opening fit and the checkbox share a single request. Once a layer has been built
  it lives in `dataLayersRef` and toggling only adds/removes the existing
  `L.geoJSON` layer. A failed fetch shows the message in the panel and returns the
  checkbox to off. Each polygon binds a sticky tooltip with `name_th`.
- Overlay styling follows the active basemap. The satellite entry is flagged
  `imagery: true`, and `dataLayerStyle()` returns the layer's `imageryStyle`
  (bright yellow `#fde047`) instead of its default dark-green `style` whenever an
  imagery basemap is on — the dark stroke is invisible against aerial photography.
  The base-layer effect re-runs `setStyle` on every existing overlay when the
  basemap changes, and a layer created later reads the current basemap from
  `activeLayerRef`. Give any new overlay both `style` and `imageryStyle`.
- Clicking a polygon used to leave a rectangle on the map: the browser focuses the
  `path.leaflet-interactive` and its default focus ring is drawn around the path's
  bounding box. `.gisMap .leaflet-interactive:focus { outline: none }` removes it,
  and a `:focus-visible` rule keeps a real ring for keyboard users.
### Add Point toolbox

- The `เพิ่มหมุด` button lives at the foot of the `ชั้นข้อมูลกลุ่มเปราะบาง` panel
  (`.gisPanelTool`, rendered only for `VULNERABLE_PANEL_TITLE`), not in a separate
  floating toolbox. It toggles `addMode`, which registers a one-shot
  `map.on("click")`. The mode hints render under the button in the same panel.
- The first map click **drops a red draggable draft pin** (`DRAFT_PIN_COLOR`, plus
  glyph) and disarms the mode — it does not open the form yet. The user drags the
  pin to adjust the position (`dragend` updates `draftPos`) and clicks it to open
  the form. Leaflet suppresses the marker `click` that follows a drag, so dragging
  never opens the form by accident.
- Draft position and form fields are separate state (`draftPos` / `draftFields` /
  `formOpen`), so the pin survives closing the form. `cancelDraft()` removes the
  marker and clears all three; the toolbox button also calls it when re-arming.
- While armed the container gets `.gisMapAdding` for a crosshair cursor. That rule
  needs two classes (`.gisMap.gisMapAdding`) to beat Leaflet's `.leaflet-grab`,
  which sets `cursor: grab` on the same element.
- The draft form (`.gisAddForm`) posts to `POST /api/gis/vulnerable`. Field order is
  **หน่วยบริการ → กลุ่ม** → ชื่อ-สกุล → เลขบัตร/เพศ → วันเกิด → บ้านเลขที่/ถนน →
  รหัสหมู่บ้าน/ชื่อหมู่บ้าน → PID last (PID is the record key and arrives from the
  search rather than being typed).
- หน่วยบริการ is a `required` `<select>` filled from
  `GET /api/gis/hospitals`, which lists `c_hospital` rows for the district in
  `AMP_CODE` (`provcode` = first 2 digits, `distcode` = last 2, `status = '1'`).
  The name field stays **disabled** until a facility is picked.
- The group `<select>` is `required` and starts on a `เลือกกลุ่ม` placeholder with
  `value=""` — no group is pre-selected, so the browser blocks the save until one is
  chosen.
- The ชื่อ-สกุล field is a search over the F43 `person` file joined to `home`
  (`GET /api/gis/person-search?q=`, 300ms debounce). It fires from **2 characters**
  and always gives feedback: results, `ไม่พบรายชื่อ`, or the error — never a silent
  empty box. Picking a result fills hospcode, pid, cid, ชื่อ-สกุล, เพศ, วันเกิด and
  the whole address in one go. `home` values of `"-"` or `"0"` mean "blank" in the
  raw file and are normalised away by `cleanText` instead of being filled in.
- HOME coverage is uneven: units that never imported the HOME file (e.g. hospcode
  `10676`, 52k persons, 0 home rows) return people with no address at all, while
  units that did import it resolve ~70-90%. Blank address fields are that, not a
  broken join.
- The search is scoped to the chosen facility (`WHERE p.hospcode = ?`) and returns
  nothing without one — searching a whole district at once gives far too many
  same-name matches to pick from. It is further limited to
  `typearea IN ('1','3')` (ประชากรในเขตรับผิดชอบ) and `discharge = '9'`
  (ยังไม่จำหน่าย). On the current data that cuts a `สม%` search
  from 3,371 rows to 589, so the 300-row scan window holds only eligible people.
- Only `person.name` is plaintext. `person.lname`, `person.cid_aes` and
  `home.house` are AES-256-GCM ciphertext written by the importer, so SQL filters
  on `p.name LIKE 'first%'` (up to 300 rows) and `webapp/lib/f43-decrypt.mjs`
  decrypts in Node (`SCAN_LIMIT` 300 rows, `RESULT_LIMIT` 20); a surname term then
  filters the decrypted `lname`. Searching by surname alone is therefore not
  supported — the placeholder says to type the given
  name first. `person.cid` itself is an MD5 hash and is never used here.
- `person.birth` is `YYYYMMDD` (converted to ISO) and `village_code` is assembled
  as `changwat + ampur + tambon + village`, each zero-padded to 2 digits. Many
  `person` rows have no matching `home` row, so the address fields often come back
  blank — that is data coverage, not a bug.
- The form is **centred in the map** (`top/left: 50%` + `translate(-50%, -50%)`)
  rather than anchored to the pin, so it can never run off an edge when the pin is
  dropped near a corner; `max-height: calc(100% - 24px)` with `overflow-y: auto`
  covers a map shorter than the form.
- The write POST and the name search are guarded by `requireGisAuth()`
  (`webapp/lib/gis-auth.mjs`), which **skips the check unless
  `NODE_ENV === "production"`** so `next dev` needs no login; the container runs
  `npm run start`, so production still requires it. The shared `requireAppAuth()`
  used by the rest of the app is untouched. Reading the map layers stays public in
  every environment. It validates hospcode/pid, an integer group,
  finite coordinates and the birth format before touching the DB, and upserts
  `ON CONFLICT (hospcode, pid)` so re-adding the same person edits the existing row
  instead of failing on the primary key. `ST_MakePoint` takes **(lng, lat)** in that
  order.
- After a successful save the layer's cached GeoJSON is dropped and its Leaflet
  layer removed so the toggle effect rebuilds it — otherwise the new pin would not
  appear until reload.

- `.gisMapWrap` carries `isolation: isolate` and `z-index: 0`. Leaflet's own layers
  go up to `z-index: 1000` (panes 400, controls 1000) while the header's menus sit
  at 30–80, so without that stacking context the map paints over the Add-On and
  user dropdowns. Keep any new map chrome inside `.gisMapWrap`.
- `ขอบเขตตำบล` reads `GET /api/gis/subdistrict-boundary`, which returns a GeoJSON
  FeatureCollection of `subdistrict_boundary` rows from PostGIS. The district is
  taken **only** from `.env` `AMP_CODE` (no query parameter):
  `districtBoundaryCode()` turns `6501` into the boundary code `TH6501`. With the
  current `AMP_CODE` that is 20 subdistricts of อ.เมืองพิษณุโลก.
- `webapp/lib/postgis.js` holds the `pg` pool. Its `globalThis` cache is keyed on
  the resolved config, so changing the GIS env does not leave a pool connected to
  the previous host — the plain `if (!cached)` form silently kept the old
  connection alive through dev hot reloads.
- Connection env (`GIS_DB_HOST`, `GIS_DB_PORT`, `GIS_DB_USER`, `GIS_DB_PASSWORD`,
  `GIS_DB_DATABASE`): `.env` points containers at the compose service name
  `postgis:5432`; `.env.local` overrides the host dev server to `localhost:5434`,
  the published port. `host.docker.internal` does **not** work from the host here
  — that address is firewalled for these ports.
- `webapp` waits for the one-shot `postgis-migrate` service. The API connection
  itself remains lazy, but a deployment will not start the webapp if required
  PostGIS schema/data migrations fail.

- The map starts centred on Phitsanulok (`[16.82, 100.26]`, zoom 9). Sizing and the
  layer-control skin live in `.gisMap` / `.gisMap .leaflet-control-layers` in
  `globals.css` — Leaflet needs an explicit container height.

### PostGIS container

- Service `postgis` / container `sub_hdc_postgis`, image `postgis/postgis:17-3.5`,
  volume `sub_hdc_postgis_data`. It is the spatial store for the GIS module and is
  separate from MariaDB — raw F43 files and the `s_*`/`t_*` transform tables stay
  where they are.
- DB `sub_hdc_gis`, user `postgres`, password `112233` (same local convention as
  MariaDB). Host port is **5434** (`5434:5432`) because 5432 and 5433 are already
  taken by other Postgres containers on the dev machine.
- The image's own initdb scripts create `postgis` and `postgis_topology` in
  `POSTGRES_DB` on first init. Do **not** bind-mount over the image's initdb
  directory — that masks those scripts and the extensions never get created.
  Verified: PostgreSQL 17.5 / PostGIS 3.5.2 with GEOS and PROJ.
- One-shot service `postgis-migrate` uses the shared `sub-hdc-migrate` Node image,
  waits for PostGIS health, then runs every top-level `migrate/postgis/*.sql` file
  transactionally through `migrate/run_postgis_migrations.js`. Applied filenames
  and SHA-256 checksums are stored in `postgis_schema_migrations`; an applied file
  must never be edited, so add a new migration for later changes. The runner does
  not recurse into `migrate/postgis/sample/`.
- `webapp` depends on successful completion of both `migrate` (MariaDB) and
  `postgis-migrate`. A normal `docker compose up -d --build` therefore creates the
  GIS tables/data automatically on both fresh and existing volumes.
- Focused test: `webapp/tests/docker-compose-migrations.test.mjs`.

#### `vulnerable` and `c_vulnerable`

- `vulnerable` is the person-level vulnerable-group registry with coordinates.
  Columns: `hospcode`, `pid`, `cid`, `fullname`, `sex`, `birth`, `vulnerable`,
  `addr_no`, `road`, `village_code` (8 digits), `village_name`,
  `geo_point geometry(Point, 4326)`. Primary key is `(hospcode, pid)`; btree
  indexes on `cid`, `vulnerable` and `village_code`, GiST on `geo_point`.
- `village_code` follows the F43 8-digit form: จังหวัด2 อำเภอ2 ตำบล2 หมู่2. The GET
  query resolves it to names by joining `subdistrict_boundary` on
  `sb.code = 'TH' || left(village_code, 6)` and returns `moo` (leading zero
  stripped), `tambon_name`, `district_name`, `province_name`. The popup renders
  those as `หมู่ที่ N ต.… อ.… จ.…`, falling back to the raw code when the join finds
  nothing. The POST rejects a `village_code` that is not exactly 8 digits.
- `c_vulnerable` is its lookup: `id`, `name`, `icon`, `is_active smallint NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 1` (same 1 = ใช้งาน / 0 = ยกเลิก meaning as the MariaDB `c_*` tables).
  Seeded with `1 = ผู้สูงอายุที่มีภาวะพึ่งพิง` (`hand-helping`),
  `2 = ผู้ป่วยติดเตียง` (`bed`), `3 = ผู้พิการ` (`accessibility`).
  `icon` names a key in `PIN_ICONS` in `components/gis-map.jsx`; a new type needs a
  code change only when it wants a glyph that registry does not have yet. `vulnerable.vulnerable` holds
  `c_vulnerable.id` as a **soft reference** — no foreign key, matching the rest of
  the schema.
- The lookup lives in PostGIS rather than beside the MariaDB `c_*` tables because
  the GIS API cannot join across the two databases.
- DDL: `migrate/postgis/20260828_create_vulnerable.sql`, applied automatically by
  `postgis-migrate`. It is idempotent and non-destructive: `CREATE TABLE / INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, an
  `ON CONFLICT` seed, and a guarded `DO` block that renames the earlier
  `vulnerable_person` / `group_name` names forward without dropping anything.
- The `vulnerable` table is created empty; no loader populates it yet. Demo rows for
  the map live in `migrate/postgis/sample/vulnerable_sample.sql` — 3 people per
  group (9 total), placed with `ST_PointOnSurface` of a subdistrict so every pin
  lands inside its own ตำบล, using the real รพ.สต. `hospcode` for that ตำบล. It is
  **not** schema: apply it only when sample data is wanted, and remove it with
  `DELETE FROM vulnerable WHERE pid LIKE 'SIM%';`.
- `GET /api/gis/vulnerable` returns rows with a non-null `geo_point` as GeoJSON
  points, joined to `c_vulnerable` for `vulnerable_name`. `?vulnerable=<id>`
  filters to one group and rejects a non-integer with 400. The join does not filter
  on `is_active`, so people carrying a retired code still appear on the map. It
  deliberately does **not** select or return `cid`, and casts `birth` with
  `to_char(..., 'YYYY-MM-DD')` because `pg` otherwise hands back a JS `Date` that
  shifts the day by the process timezone.

#### Boundary tables

- `public.district_boundary` (9 rows) and `public.subdistrict_boundary` (93 rows)
  were imported on 2026-08-28 from the separate `gis-postgis` container of the
  `E:\NextJS\gis` project (db `gis`, user `gis`). Both are
  `geometry(MultiPolygon, 4326)` and cover Phitsanulok only (`province_code`
  `TH65`); codes are `TH65NN` for districts and `TH65NNNN` for subdistricts.
  Primary keys, the `code` unique indexes, the GiST geometry indexes, and the id
  sequences came across with the dump.
- Durable migration `migrate/postgis/20260828_create_boundaries.sql` now carries
  both schemas and all 102 canonical rows. It creates the tables/indexes when
  absent and upserts by `code` without dropping site-specific extra rows. Geometry
  must remain valid `MultiPolygon` with SRID 4326; guarded checks require at least
  9 district and 93 subdistrict rows. This migration is applied automatically by
  `postgis-migrate`, so a fresh host no longer depends on another project's
  container or a manual `pg_dump` transfer.

## F43 importer: stalled `LOAD DATA` recovery

- `webapp/lib/import_f43_load_data.js` tracks byte activity from the
  `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` source stream. If no bytes are read for
  `IMPORT_LOAD_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `900000`, 15 minutes), it destroys
  only that pooled DB connection and raises `ETIMEDOUT`.
- The importer daemon already classifies `ETIMEDOUT` as transient, returns the ZIP
  from `processing` to `queue`, resets the same `log_import_file` row to
  `pending`, and retries up to `IMPORT_MAX_REQUEUES` (default 3).
- The inactivity timer resets for every stream chunk and stops at EOF, so it does
  not kill a healthy long-running import or slow MySQL work after all bytes have
  been delivered.
- Keep `IMPORT_LOAD_NET_TIMEOUT=3600` and the two-hour
  `IMPORT_CHILD_TIMEOUT_MS` watchdog as outer safety limits. Do not lower the
  session network timeout to 600 seconds; a valid large table has previously
  exceeded that duration.
- Focused verification:
  `cd webapp; node --test tests/import-f43.test.mjs tests/import-daemon.test.mjs`.

## Failed import log retention

- Loading `/import-check/log-import` calls `POST /api/log-import/cleanup` before
  fetching the first table page. The shared `/dashboard/log-import` route does
  not trigger this cleanup.
- Cleanup deletes only `log_import_file` rows whose status is `not_complate` or
  legacy `no_complete` and whose `import_date_time` is strictly older than five
  days:
  `import_date_time < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 5 DAY)`.
- Rows exactly five days old and all `pending`, `processing`, and `complete`
  rows are preserved.
- Focused verification:
  `cd webapp; node --test tests/log-import-cleanup.test.mjs tests/log-import-page.test.mjs`.

## ProviderID login

- `/login` keeps username/password and adds `เข้าสู่ระบบด้วย ProviderID` as the primary action.
- When no valid local callback URL is supplied, both sign-in methods redirect to `/import-check/compare-hdc-person`.
- Authentication starts at Health ID OAuth, returns to `/api/auth/healthid`, exchanges the Health ID token for a Provider ID token/profile, and creates an Auth.js JWT session.
- The protected-page `callbackUrl` is kept in the short-lived, httpOnly `provider_callback_url` cookie.
- First-time ProviderID users are inserted into `c_user_provider` with the active `user` role ID from `c_user_role`. Returning users refresh profile and `last_activity`; users with `is_active = 0` are denied.
- Required env names: `HEALTH_CLIENT_ID`, `HEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `HEALTH_REDIRECT_URI`, `PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID`, `PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Admin user management

- `/admin` is available only to the configured `.env` account or a ProviderID user with `c_user_provider.role = 1`; the API repeats the same authorization check.
- The configured username/password account receives the `admin` role. `c_user_provider.role` stores `c_user_role.id`, which is resolved to its role name for ProviderID sessions.
- `/api/admin/users` lists non-sensitive user fields and allows only `role_id`, `is_active`, and `note` updates. It never returns `cid_hash` or the saved profile.
- Administrators can hard-delete another ProviderID user after an explicit confirmation; they cannot delete their own ProviderID account.
- The user menu shows `Manage users` only for administrators.
- Role/status changes apply to the user's next login because ProviderID sessions are JWT-based with a 24-hour maximum age.
- `c_user_provider.login_count` starts at 1 on the first successful ProviderID login and increments on every later successful ProviderID login; `/admin` displays it as `LOGIN (ครั้ง)`.

  ข้อความ breadcrumb ทุกระดับใช้ขนาด 15px

## แบบแผน UI (ตกลงกับ user แล้ว — ต้องทำตาม)

- **ห้ามมี label เกินจำเป็น** — filter control ไม่มี visible label ใช้
  placeholder หรือ default option ที่สื่อความหมายแทน (ใส่
  `<span className="srOnly">` เพื่อ accessibility); subtitle/หัวคอลัมน์/
  ข้อความ meta สั้นพอสื่อความหมาย ไม่อธิบายซ้ำกับสิ่งที่ UI สื่ออยู่แล้ว
- **คอลัมน์หน่วยบริการ**: รหัสนำหน้า ตามด้วยชื่อย่อใน
  `<span className="hospNameShort">` บรรทัดเดียว — ชื่อย่อจาก
  `getHospNameMap` (`c_hospital.hospname_short`)
- **คอลัมน์ตัวเลขสำคัญแยกสี**: กำหนดเป็นคู่ class `<ชื่อ>Header/<ชื่อ>Cell`
  ใน `globals.css` ใช้ทั้ง `<th>` และ `<td>` เสมอ
- **stat cards**: `statGrid` + `statCard` (icon/value/label) แสดง "…"
  ระหว่างโหลด
- **datagrid header label**: ป้ายบอกที่มา/เวลาของข้อมูลเหนือตาราง —
  บรรทัดเดียวชิดขวา ตัวเล็กจาง (font 11px น้ำหนักปกติ สี `var(--muted)`)
  มี icon lucide เล็ก (13px) นำหน้า สื่อความหมายของข้อมูล เช่น `RefreshCw`
  สำหรับเวลา sync/ประมวลผล; ระหว่างโหลดแสดง "…" — ต้นแบบ:
  `.compareHdcSyncMeta` (หน้า `/import-check/compare-hdc-person`)
- **ตารางแบบ group คอลัมน์** (หลายค่าใต้หัวข้อเดียว เช่น HDC/SUB-HDC/ส่วนต่าง
  ต่อ type): thead 2 ชั้น — ชั้นแรกคอลัมน์คงที่ใช้ `rowSpan={2}` + หัวกลุ่ม
  `colSpan` ชั้นสองเป็นคอลัมน์ย่อย; คั่นกลุ่มด้วยเส้นซ้าย
  (`border-left` บนหัวกลุ่มและคอลัมน์แรกของกลุ่ม เช่น
  `compareGroupHeader`/`compareGroupCol`); กลุ่มสำคัญเน้นด้วยคู่ class
  `<ชื่อ>Header/<ชื่อ>Cell` ตามข้อบน กลุ่มรองกดให้เล็กและจางด้วย class
  เดียวทั้ง th/td (เช่น `compareDimCol`)
- **ส่งออก xlsx ราย row**: หัวคอลัมน์ "รายชื่อแบบปกปิด" + icon
  `FileSpreadsheet` (class `exportXlsxLink`) ลิงก์ตรงไป API export —
  endpoint ต้อง login ไม่งั้น redirect ไป `/error/msg`
  (ดู @handoff/hand-off-err.md) และห้ามส่งออกคอลัมน์ `cid`

## โครงหน้าตารางมาตรฐาน

`ModuleHeader` → `statGrid` → toolbar (ค้นหา + ปุ่มรีเฟรช) → `tableMeta`
(+ "Transform ล่าสุด" จาก `log_transform`) → `tableWrap > fileTable`

data flow: page (client) → `fetch("/api/...", { cache: "no-store" })` →
API route อ่าน**ตารางสรุปของ transform** (ไม่ query ตารางดิบ) — หน้าใหม่
ควรมี API + ตารางสรุปของตัวเอง ดู @handoff/hand-off-transform.md

## การทดสอบ

```powershell
cd webapp
node --test tests\*.test.mjs
```

## Root landing page

- `/` uses the standard `main dashboardMain > panel panelWide dashboardPanel > ModuleHeader` shell.
- The page body presents three cards, one per main tab: ปริมาณข้อมูล (`/import-check/index`), คุณภาพข้อมูล (`/quality`), GIS (`/gis`).
- The cards stack in one column (icon left, title + text right) beside `LandingDistrictMap`; below 980px the map moves under the cards.
- Focused source test: `webapp/tests/landing-page.test.mjs`.
